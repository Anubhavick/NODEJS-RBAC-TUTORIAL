🛠️ Getting Started
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/Anubhavick/NODEJS-RBAC-TUTORIAL.git
cd NODEJS-RBAC-TUTORIAL
Install dependencies

bash
npm install
Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file and set your variables (e.g., DB connection, JWT secret)
Run the app

bash
npm start
##📚 How It Works
User Signup/Login:
Users can register and log in to receive a JWT token.

##Assigning Roles:
Assign roles such as admin, user, manager to users.

##Protecting Routes:
Middleware functions check JWT and verify user roles before granting access to certain endpoints.

##Custom Permissions:
Easily extend roles and permissions to suit your needs.

🌟 Example Usage
js
// Example: Protecting a route for admins only
router.get('/admin', authorize('admin'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome Admin!');
});
